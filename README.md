# Roadcrosser game


Welcome!
The Roadcrosser game is a 2 Player 2D Top-Down-Shooter Style Game, where the objective is To cross the road, or outlive your enemy!

Both Players have the same goal, to reach their objective on the other side of the road. The problem is that there is a busy road between them and the objective, and the other player is hostile! And there's lava.

Players have 3 lives, when they reach 0 lives, the enemy wins. If they outlive the enemy, or reach their objective before the enemy reaches theirs, the Player wins.

Players take 1 damage (1 HP loss) whenever they are struck by a Bullet or are hit by a Car. Stepping in lava instantly kills the Player.

The Players rotate and can shoot in either direction (Rotation is visible).

## In regards to the task
Instead of going for one of the games in the list, I decided to mix 2 of them.

The game is a combination of the Jumper Frog game, where you need to cross the road And the Duel game, where you shoot another player, The increased intensity this adds to each game creates something very nice.

Also, in regards to task A, Where I didn't implement an HP system as I felt it made the game too easy, here I did add section 3 of part A - Multiple lives.
